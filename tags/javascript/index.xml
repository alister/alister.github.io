If they are static HTML &amp;amp; Javascript-based, then creating them as Github pages, available as sub-directories on this site (beyond all the existing pages here) can be a quick and easy way to show them.
However, there&amp;rsquo;s not been a good way to link to them, and show them off - so this is just the introduction to the new page in the menu above - and the link to some of my projects.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://alister.github.io/projects/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 20:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alister.github.io/projects/</guid><description>September 2019 On my second visit to An Evening Of Unnecessary Detail, Geoff Marshall (and Vicki!) were one of the guests on-stage. Geoff had made an app for Windows, called the &amp;lsquo;Station Initials Lookup Tool&amp;rsquo; that he showed off as part of his set. I thought it would be a fun project to put much the same data online as a simple website. Once I had done that, I looked around for a similar list of codes - and remembered the IATA codes for airports - and so I created that site for lookups as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
