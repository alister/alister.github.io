&lt;a href="https://www.datasouth.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.datasouth.co.uk/&lt;/a>. We had dozens of domain names, and organising the changes - as well as paying per domain name, was getting to be, well, annoying, as well as potentially expensive.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://tinydns.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TinyDNS&lt;/a> - which is worthy of its own post. To add a new domain name, create a small file with the relevant lines, with one per DNS record - really easy if you have any kind of database or automation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
