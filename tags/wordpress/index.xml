&lt;a href="https://www.bytemark.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.bytemark.co.uk/&lt;/a> (with whom I&amp;rsquo;ve had a small virtual machine since April 2004). One of the things I really like about Bytemark was the free DNS hosting they provided, particularly since they used
&lt;a href="https://tinydns.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TinyDNS&lt;/a> - which is worthy of its own post. To add a new domain name, create a small file with the relevant lines, with one per DNS record - really easy if you have any kind of database or automation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
