I&amp;rsquo;ve taken some time over the holidays to do a little re-organisation of my online presence, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to tell you what I did, and how.

As it is build on Octopress/Jekyll, it is also well supported by Github, and allows me to add static content pages into the site as well, so I&amp;rsquo;ve moved my online presentations here, from https://abulman.</description></item></channel></rss>
