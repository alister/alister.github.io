One of the most impressive things about Symfony are the deprecation warnings - it will tell you what needs to be changed or upgraded ahead of time (the only time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen otherwise was a security fix). I&amp;rsquo;d suggest a quick look at the framework updates as and when they are released to keep up to date with things, to give you plenty of time to update before the next minor/major releases.</description></item><item><title>Contributing to open source can be easy</title><link>https://alister.github.io/blog/2014/07/12/contributing-to-open-source-can-be-easy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2014 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alister.github.io/blog/2014/07/12/contributing-to-open-source-can-be-easy/</guid><description>Although I&amp;rsquo;m busy day to day at my current contract *, that isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that my passions outside the office have come to a complete stop. I&amp;rsquo;m still going to regular meetups (like the PHP London Meetup and Docker London), and I&amp;rsquo;m also planning to go to Symfony Live London 2014. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been reading about, and trying some software, and making the odd fix and new code for myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
