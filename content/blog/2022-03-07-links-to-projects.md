Occasionally, I'll write small largely stand-alone projects. If they are static HTML & Javascript-based, then creating them as Github pages, available as sub-directories on this site (beyond all the existing pages here) can be a quick and easy way to show them.

However, there's not been a good way to link to them, and show them off - so this is just the introduction to the new page in the menu above - and the link to [some of my projects](/projects/).
