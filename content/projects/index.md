## September 2019

On my second visit to [An Evening Of Unnecessary Detail](https://festivalofthespokennerd.com/show/an-evening-of-unnecessary-detail/), [Geoff Marshall](https://www.youtube.com/user/geofftech2/featured) (and Vicki!) were one of the guests on-stage. Geoff had made an app for Windows, called the 'Station Initials Lookup Tool' that he showed off as part of his set. I thought it would be a fun project to put much the same data online as a simple website. Once I had done that, I looked around for a similar list of codes - and remembered the IATA codes for airports - and so I created that site for lookups as well.

Originally, I wanted to try out Symfony v4 using Flex, and using Webpack for Javascript & CSS processing. Now, these are all-Javascript & Webpack sites on the frontend - though the IATA codes are fetched and processed to pre-create the Javascript lookup table with a simple PHP class, run by a Symfony command.

* [Initials to 3-letter code stations lookup](https://alister.github.io/station-initials_v2/)
  * for example: 'PAD' is the British Rail station code for 'London Paddington'
* [Initials to 3-letter IATA airports](https://alister.github.io/airport-code-initials/)
  * 'KBP' is the IATA airport code for 'Boryspil International Airport, Kyiv, Ukraine'

## 2001:

##### Lets keep it simple
I designed these flag options a long time ago, around the year 2001, following some discussion (and a competition) on the main [moon society](http://www.moonsociety.org/) mailing list regarding a flag. Several were produced, but they were all very complicated. This was my idea.

* Thoughts for a [Luna flag](https://abulman.co.uk/luna/).
