One of the most impressive things about Symfony are the deprecation warnings - it will tell you what needs to be changed or upgraded ahead of time (the only time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen otherwise was a security fix). I&amp;rsquo;d suggest a quick look at the framework updates as and when they are released to keep up to date with things, to give you plenty of time to update before the next minor/major releases.</description></item><item><title>Links to Projects</title><link>https://alister.github.io/blog/2022/03/07/links-to-projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 20:25:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alister.github.io/blog/2022/03/07/links-to-projects/</guid><description>Occasionally, I&amp;rsquo;ll write small largely stand-alone projects. If they are static HTML &amp;amp; Javascript-based, then creating them as Github pages, available as sub-directories on this site (beyond all the existing pages here) can be a quick and easy way to show them.
However, there&amp;rsquo;s not been a good way to link to them, and show them off - so this is just the introduction to the new page in the menu above - and the link to some of my projects.</description></item><item><title>PHP Gotcha: Using php://temp</title><link>https://alister.github.io/blog/2022/02/27/php-gotcha-using-php-temp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 14:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alister.github.io/blog/2022/02/27/php-gotcha-using-php-temp/</guid><description>Just a quicky post, that I hope will save someone (or myself) some head-scratching later.
TLDR: Whenever you fopen('php://temp', $mode) you get a new file.
I found this out when exporting some data from the DB to a spreadsheet/CSV. I was using Yectep\PhpSpreadsheetBundle\Factory (a Symfony bundle around phpoffice/phpspreadsheet) which had a handy method to save the file:
$writer = $this-&amp;gt;spreadsheetFactory-&amp;gt;createWriter($spreadsheet, &amp;#39;.csv&amp;#39;); $writer-&amp;gt;save(&amp;#39;php://temp&amp;#39;); From there I would read it back, and upload it to a cloudfiles storage account using FlySystem:</description></item><item><title>Contributing to open source can be easy</title><link>https://alister.github.io/blog/2014/07/12/contributing-to-open-source-can-be-easy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2014 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alister.github.io/blog/2014/07/12/contributing-to-open-source-can-be-easy/</guid><description>Although I&amp;rsquo;m busy day to day at my current contract *, that isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that my passions outside the office have come to a complete stop. I&amp;rsquo;m still going to regular meetups (like the PHP London Meetup and Docker London), and I&amp;rsquo;m also planning to go to Symfony Live London 2014. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been reading about, and trying some software, and making the odd fix and new code for myself.</description></item><item><title>Not having your developers quit on you - as a service</title><link>https://alister.github.io/blog/2013/02/17/not-having-your-developers-quit-on-you-as-a-service/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2013 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alister.github.io/blog/2013/02/17/not-having-your-developers-quit-on-you-as-a-service/</guid><description>&lt;style type="text/css">

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s never good when someone feels they need to quit a job (or contract) rather than be able to continue, but sometimes, if the environment that they are working is so just so toxic and/or painful to work within, then it can be the best thing for all parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I particularly keen to admit that I&amp;rsquo;ve done it twice in the last five months. It&amp;rsquo;s useful to tell you the why, of what happened though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I like djbdns &amp; tinydns</title><link>https://alister.github.io/blog/2013/01/07/why-i-like-djbdns-tinydns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2013 12:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alister.github.io/blog/2013/01/07/why-i-like-djbdns-tinydns/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using TinyDNS, and the associated systems, like DNScache and DaemonTools since 2003, when I was first tasked with setting up a local DNS resolver, and a DNS server for a web-development company I was working at

I&amp;rsquo;ve taken some time over the holidays to do a little re-organisation of my online presence, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to tell you what I did, and how.
First up, is this site. I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering what to put onto my Github pages for a while, and I think the most obvious thing are links to my recent work. As it is build on Octopress/Jekyll, it is also well supported by Github, and allows me to add static content pages into the site as well, so I&amp;rsquo;ve moved my online presentations here, from https://abulman.</description></item></channel></rss>
